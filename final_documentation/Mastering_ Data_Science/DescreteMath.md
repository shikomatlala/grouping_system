SET
A set is a collection of objectS(element) //This explanation contained in the next brackets is not correct(members, tuples [But a tuple is a row - How can it therefore be an object?])
example 
A = Students in this class [A can represent the quantity of students]
B = {1,3, 4, 7}
Z = integers
//Pretty much think about an array 



ELEMENT
Individuals objects inside our set (For the sake of this definition I am not going to call them memebrs - For we do not yet know the definition of Element)
therefore.
John E A - This means John is an Element of A //Where 'E' is a symbol for Element
3 E B
3 E Z - What about values that are not elements of the integer set.
    Therefore the answer is 3 E/ Z - Remember that here the slash means not


SUBSET
When every element of set X are Included set Y and Y has more(larger set) elements than X we say X is a subset of Y

RULES ABOUT SETS
- The order of elements in a set is immeterial
  



⊆





The symbol "⊆" means "is a subset of". ... Since all of the members of set A are members of set B, A is a subset of B. Symbolically this is represented as A ⊆ B. Although A ⊆ B, since there are no members of set B that are NOT members of set A (A = B), A is NOT a proper subset of B.
